# Fashion MNIST TensorFlow Lite Project

This project demonstrates how to train a CNN model using the Fashion MNIST dataset and convert it to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

## Steps:
1. Train a CNN model using TensorFlow.
2. Convert the trained model to TFLite.
3. Optimize the model for deployment.

## How to Use:
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/fashion-mnist-tflite.git
